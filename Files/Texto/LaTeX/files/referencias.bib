  abstract = {Abstract This paper addresses the school timetabling problem, which consists of defining the date and time in which classes will be given by teachers in educational institutions. For this purpose, a tool that uses Operational Research (OR) techniques was developed, focused on generating and optimizing Elementary and High School timetables, taking into account teachers' preferences for certain days or for sequenced (twinned) classes. Conductive to solving the problem, a Non Linear Binary Integer Programming mathematical model (NLBIP) and Local Search (LS) and Iterated Local Search (ILS) procedures were comparatively applied. A real problem with 14 timetables of public schools in the city of Araucária (in Paraná State, Brazil) was analyzed. The results indicate that the computational time required by the mathematical model is feasible for the problems in question. The ILS technique has the potential for testing larger scale problems, as it presents a dispersion of 3.5\% to 7.7\% relative to the optimal solution (obtained by the NLBIP) and a computational time that is 15 to 338 times faster. ,  Resumo Este artigo aborda o problema de otimização na geração da grade horária escolar. Tal problema consiste em definir os dias e horários das disciplinas a serem ministradas por cada um dos professores de instituições de ensino. Para isto foi desenvolvida uma ferramenta que faz uso de técnicas de Pesquisa Operacional (PO), com foco na geração e otimização de grade horária de instituições de Ensino Fundamental, considerando as preferências dos professores, tais como, preferências por dias de aula e por aulas em sequência (geminadas). Para a resolução do problema foi utilizado um modelo matemático de Programação Não Linear Inteira Binária (PNLIB) e os procedimentos Busca Local (BL) e Iterated Local Search (ILS), comparativamente. Foi aqui analisado um problema real com 14 grades horárias de escolas públicas da cidade de Araucária, PR. Os resultados indicam que o tempo computacional demandado pelo modelo matemático é viável para os problemas analisados. A técnica ILS possui potencial para testes em problemas de maior porte, já que apresenta uma dispersão de 3,5\% a 7,7\% em relação à solução ótima (obtida pelo PNLIB), com tempo computacional de 15 a 338 vezes mais rápido.},

  abstract  = {Goal of this research is to introduce how the implementation of Interaction Design can solve problem of UI/UX in mobile devices. The method used here is Interaction Design, the study of designing interactive digital products with user-centered approach to deliver engaging and better user experiences (UX). One of interesting interactive product is University Timetable Plotting System, an application used to manage course scheduling that produces busy screen with large timetable. Problems occurred because this system have inadequate support for user with relatively low resolution (like smartphone) compared to desktop thus affect negative UX. Interaction design workflow begins with collecting data to establishing requirement, following with designing alternatives. Based on usability evaluation, Instruction approach proved to produce high satisfaction rating rather than direct manipulation approach. This research proved that Interaction Design could be utilize on the process of creating Interactive Products. In conclusion its challenging to convert plotting UI into mobile version and this paper demonstrate that Interaction design successfully guides developer and UI designer to design better UI/UX experiences.},

  abstract = {One of the decision problems in many organizations and institutions is to decide how to schedule different tasks, in particular, in higher education institutions. One of the main problems is the university course timetabling problem (UCTP): this problem consists of the allocation of events (courses, professors, and students) to a number of fixed time slots and rooms, this at the beginning of each academic period of the universities. The existent formulations include particular requirements from different educational levels and institutions, as in our case. In this paper, we focus on the university course timetabling problem with the assignment of professor-course-time slot for an institution in Mexico. Timetabling is constructed for the disciplinary courses that are offered by one of the academic departments. The main characteristics are as follows: (1) there are full-time and part-time professors; (2) a mandatory fixed number of courses has to be assigned to each full-time professor according to their academic profile; (3) there is a maximum number of courses assigned to part-time professors; (4) a professor-course matrix that specifies the valid assignation is defined; and (5) mandatory time periods for courses in different semesters are established and other traditional constraints. We present the integer linear programming model proposed to solve the case studied. The optimal solution was obtained with low computational effort through the classical branch-and-bound algorithm. We describe the complete timetable to show the model effectiveness.},

Academic Timetabling is the procedure of assigning classes to time-slots and classrooms, subjected to various constraints. For example in Examination timetabling scheduling problem, we have to assign various exams to different time periods in a way that satisfies a set of constraints and preferences. Many researchers worked on various timetabling problems.University course timetable scheduling, Exmination time table scheduling and school time table scheduling are some examples of academic time scheduling problems.In this paper , we presented detailed review of the said problems.},

É classificado, em termos de complexidade computacional, como NP-hard, o que implica grande exigência de capacidade de processamento. É modelado de maneiras muito diversas, no intuito de se obter adequação quanto ao contexto educacional do país, às regras específicas da instituição ou aos objetivos específicos dos gestores, entre outros. Neste artigo, propõe-se um modelo matemático para construir grades de horários, otimizando a utilização de salas de aula. Para resolver o modelo proposto, desenvolveu-se um algoritmo que divide o problema para viabilizar o uso de programação linear inteira mista. Experimentos computacionais aplicados a uma base de dados real de uma universidade pública brasileira confirmaram o bom desempenho da abordagem proposta, reduzindo consideravelmente a quantidade de salas de aulas alocadas. ,  Abstract: Creating timetables for courses is a problem that universities face at the beginning of every semester. This activity represents an important administrative task because it consumes significant amount of resources. In terms of computational complexity, this is classified as NP-hard, as it demands a huge amount of processing capacity. Timetabling is modeled in a number of different ways, aiming to fit the country's educational context, meet specific rules of institutions of higher education or specific goals of managers, among others. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to solve the University Course Timetabling Problem and optimize classroom utilization. To solve the proposed model, an algorithm that divides the problem was developed, solving it with mixed integer linear programming tools. Computational experiments applied to a real database of a Brazilian public university confirmed the good performance of the proposed approach, which greatly reduces the amount of assigned classrooms.},

  abstract = {Abstract Course timetables are the organizational foundation of a university's educational program. While students and lecturers perceive timetable quality individually according to their preferences, there are also collective criteria derived normatively such as balanced workloads or idle time avoidance. A recent challenge and opportunity in curriculum-based timetabling consists of customizing timetables with respect to individual student preferences and with respect to integrating online courses as part of modern course programs or in reaction to flexibility requirements as posed in pandemic situations. Curricula consisting of (large) lectures and (small) tutorials further open the possibility for optimizing not only the lecture and tutorial plan for all students but also the assignments of individual students to tutorial slots. In this paper, we develop a multi-level planning process for university timetabling: On the tactical level, a lecture and tutorial plan is determined for a set of study programs; on the operational level, individual timetables are generated for each student interlacing the lecture plan through a selection of tutorials from the tutorial plan favoring individual preferences. We utilize this mathematical-programming-based planning process as part of a matheuristic which implements a genetic algorithm in order to improve lecture plans, tutorial plans, and individual timetables so as to find an overall university program with well-balanced timetable performance criteria. Since the evaluation of the fitness function amounts to invoking the entire planning process, we additionally provide a proxy in the form of an artificial neural network metamodel. Computational results exhibit the procedure's capability of generating high quality schedules.},

  abstract = {Student's academic performance is the point of interest for both the student and the academic institution in higher education. This performance can be affected by several factors and one of them is student absences. This is mainly due to the missed lectures and other class activities. Studies related to university timetabling investigate the different techniques and algorithms to design course timetables without analyzing the relationship between student attendance behavior and timetable design. This article first aimed at demonstrating the impact of absences and timetabling design on student's academic performance. Secondly, this study showed that the number of absences can be caused by three main timetable design factors: namely, (1) the number of courses per semester, (2) the average number of lectures per day and (3) the average number of free timeslots per day. This was demonstrated using Educational Data Mining on a large dataset collected from Prince Sultan University. The results showed a high prediction performance reaching 92\% when predicting student's GPA based on absences and the factors related to timetabling design. High prediction performance reaching 87\% was also obtained when predicting student absences based on the three timetable factors mentioned above. The results demonstrated the importance of designing course timetables in view of student absence behavior. Some suggestions were reported such as limiting the number of enrolled courses based on student's GPA, avoiding busy and almost free days and using automated timetabling to minimize the number of predicted absences. This in turn will help in generating balanced student timetables, and thus improving student academic performance.},

  abstract = {Many mathematical optimization problems from real-life applications are NP-hard, and hence no algorithm that solves them to optimality within a reasonable time is known. For this reason, metaheuristic methods are mostly preferred when their size is big. Many meta-heuristic methods have been proposed to solve various combinatorial optimization problems. One of the newly introduced metaheuristic methods is a bat-inspired algorithm, which is based on the echolocation behaviour of microbats. Bat algorithm (BA) and its variants have been used successfully to solve several optimization problems. However, from the No-free Lunch Theorem, it is known that there is no universal metaheuristic method that can solve efficiently all optimization problems. Thus, this study work focused on investigating the usefulness of BA in solving an optimization problem called Course Teaching Problem (CTP). Since BA was originally designed to solve continuous problems, and CTP is a combinatorial optimization problem, a discrete version of BA for CPT has been proposed and tested using real-life data from the Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE). The algorithm has produced promising results, as in each execution test, it generated a timetable in which all hard constraints were met and soft constraints were significantly satisfied within a few iterations.

  abstract = {Abstract Public transportation networks are typically operated with a periodic timetable. The periodic event scheduling problem (PESP) is the standard mathematical modeling tool for periodic timetabling. PESP is a computationally very challenging problem: For example, solving the instances of the benchmarking library PESPlib to optimality seems out of reach. Since PESP can be solved in linear time on trees, and the treewidth is a rather small graph parameter in the networks of the PESPlib, it is a natural question to ask whether there are polynomial-time algorithms for input networks of bounded treewidth, or even better, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. We show that deciding the feasibility of a PESP instance is NP-hard even when the treewidth is 2, the branchwidth is 2, or the carvingwidth is 3. Analogous results hold for the optimization of reduced PESP instances, where the feasibility problem is trivial. Moreover, we show W[1]-hardness of the general feasibility problem with respect to treewidth, which means that we can most likely only accomplish pseudo-polynomial-time algorithms on input networks with bounded tree- or branchwidth. We present two such algorithms based on dynamic programming. We further analyze the parameterized complexity of PESP with bounded cyclomatic number, diameter, or vertex cover number. For event-activity networks with a special—but standard—structure, we give explicit and sharp bounds on the branchwidth in terms of the maximum degree and the carvingwidth of an underlying line network. Finally, we investigate several parameters on the smallest instance of the benchmarking library PESPlib.},

In addition students and examiners can find out the exam schedule that must be done through the application. But the semester exam scheduling application is not yet available at educational institutions. Before building a good semester exam scheduling application requires a semester exam scheduling application design, so this design can meet all the needs needed when building an application.

@book{SWEBOK2014,
  abstract  = {The purpose of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge is to provide a validated classification of the bounds of the software engineering discipline and topical access that will support this discipline. The Body of Knowledge is subdivided into a set of software engineering Knowledge Areas (KA) that differentiate among the various important concepts, allowing readers to find their way quickly to subjects of interest. Upon finding a subject, readers are referred to key papers or book chapters. SWEBOK Guide V3.0 builds upon SWEBOK 2004 to refresh and add new reviewed content. Emphases on engineering practice lead the Guide toward a strong relationship with the normative literature. The normative literature is validated by consensus formed among practitioners and is concentrated in standards and related documents. The two major standards bodies for software engineering (IEEE Computer Society Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7) are represented in the project. The Guide is oriented toward a variety of audiences, all over the world. It aims to serve public and private organizations in need of a consistent view of software engineering for defining education and training requirements, classifying jobs, developing performance evaluation policies or specifying software development tasks. It also addresses practicing, or managing, software engineers and the officials responsible for making public policy regarding licensing and professional guidelines. In addition, professional societies and educators defining the certification rules, accreditation policies for university curricula, and guidelines for professional practice will benefit from the SWEBOK Guide, as well as the students learning the software engineering profession and educators and trainers engaged in defining curricula and course content. It is hoped that readers will find this book useful in guiding them toward the knowledge and resources they need in their lifelong career development as software engineering professionals.},

  abstract = {The fifth International Timetabling Competition ITC2021 aims to instigate further research on automated sports timetabling. The competition’s problem consists of constructing a compact double round-robin tournament with 16 to 20 teams while respecting various hard constraints and minimizing the penalties from violated soft constraints. This paper focuses on the organization of the ITC2021 competition, with a particular focus on the generation of a set of artificial though challenging, realistic, and diverse problem instances. For the latter, we present a set of features describing the structure of the problem instances, and use these features to construct the so-called instance space for sports timetabling. Several gaps in this space hint that existing problem instances from the literature are not very diverse. We therefore propose a novel integer programming approach to determine the feature values that cover these gaps, and show how to generate associated problem instances. Finally, we provide an overview of the participants and their contributions.}

  abstract  = {Computer solution of timetabling, scheduling and rostering problems has been addressed in the literature since the 1950's. Early mathematical formulations proved impossible to solve given the limited computer power of the era. However, heuristics, often very specialised, were used for certain problems from a very early date, although the term heuristic was not generally recognised until later; a few guaranteed optimality, some consistently produced good solutions, but most became unwieldy when adjusted to deal with practical situations. In some cases, weaknesses in the heuristics were overcome by appeal to manual intervention. Mathematical approaches to some problems returned to favour, successfully, around 1980. Some of the subsequent developments of these are very powerful in practical situations, but they are no panacea, and metaheuristics are the flavour of the nineties.},
